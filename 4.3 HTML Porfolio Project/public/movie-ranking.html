<H2>My top 3 Movies/Animes of all time</H2>

<Hr/>

<H3>Ratatouille</H3>
<P>A really great movie and watching it in french was fun.</P>

<H3>Detective Conan</H3>
<P>Great series if you like detective works, always fun to try and figure out the case.</P>

<H3>The Conjuring 2</H3>
<P>The end was unexpected in a way, Valek was also fun. There were some foreshadowing about Valek but it 
    took another run to notice.
