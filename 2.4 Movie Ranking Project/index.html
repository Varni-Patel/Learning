<H1>The Best Movies/Anime according to Varni</H1>

<H2>My top 3 Movies/Animes of all time</H2>

<Hr/>

<H3>Ratatouille</H3>
<P>A really great movie. Had to watch it in French class and it was quite an experience.</P>

<H3>Detective Conan</H3>
<P>Great series if you like detective works, always fun to try and figure out the case before the reveal.</P>

<H3>The Conjuring 2</H3>
<P>The end was unexpected in a way, the makeup for Valek was kinda creepy. There were some foreshadowing about Valek but it
    took another run to notice.
